This is a real-time collab app similar to trello where one can login and create boards
Each board has column and cards which can be given title, moved with drag and drop functionality and delete as well
There is a members section in each board where the user or creator of the board can add a new member via email to that board and work collaboratively 

Tech used:
- Websocket for real-time functionality
- Redux for state management
- NextAuth for authorization
- Tailwind for design
- Postgres for database
